Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha4 Flopsie Installation Instructions
=========================================================

Before beginning installation, be sure to at least skim [the other
pages](index.html) for this release of Bedrock Linux (1.0alpha4 Flopsie).  Make
sure you're aware of, for example, the [known issues](knownissues.html) and
[troubleshooting advice](troubleshooting.html) before you begin following the
instructions below.

If you are currently using a previous version of Bedrock Linux, note that many
of the existing directories from your current installation may be used in this
release unaltered: `/home`, `/root`, and `/boot`.  Additionally `/var/chroot`
still exists; however, it was moved to `/bedrock/clients`.  When these
directories come up in the following instructions, consider simply copying the
old values over the ones created here.  Additionally, it could be useful to
keep your configuration files, such as `brclients.conf` and `/etc/passwd`, to
reference.

## {id="installer-host"} Installation Host Environment

First, boot a Linux distribution from a device/partition other than the one on
which you wish to install Bedrock Linux. This will be called the "installer
host." The installer host can be a LiveCD or LiveUSB Linux distribution (such
as Knoppix or an Ubuntu installer), or simply a normal Linux distribution on
another device or another partition on the same device. However, when using a
live environment, make sure your machine has at least 2GB of RAM, as the live
environment must be able to compile the kernel.

Most major Linux distributions will work for installer host, provided they
support compiling tools such as `make`.  Distributions with ready access to
`debootstrap` (such as most major Debian-based distributions, Arch Linux
through AUR, Fedora, and others) are preferable if you would like a
Debian-based client, as they will make it relatively easy to acquire said
client through `debootstrap`.  The installer host should also have internet
access.

Be sure the installer host uses the same instruction set as you wish Bedrock
Linux to use. Specifically, watch out for (32-bit) x86 live Linux distribution
if you wish to make Bedrock Linux (64-bit) x86-64. While it is possible have
the installer host use a different instruction set from the targeted Bedrock,
it is a bit more work and not covered in these instructions.

If the computer on which you wish to install Bedrock Linux is slow, you may
find it preferable to use another computer to do the CPU-intensive compiling.
These instructions do not cover compiling on a separate machine from the one on
which you wish to install.


## {id="partitioning"} Partitioning

Using partitioning software such as gparted or fdisk, partition the device on
which you wish to install Bedrock Linux. Be very careful to only format bits
and bytes which you no longer need - a mistake here could blow away another
operating system with which you intended to dual-boot with Bedrock.

For the most part you are free to partition the system however you please. If
you are unsure of how to partition it, it is reasonable to use only two
partitions:

1. Your main partition for mounting the root directory (ie, `/`)
2. A swap partition.  Recommendations for swap sizes usually vary between equal
to your RAM size to two-and-a-half times your RAM size.

If you are comfortable with typical partitioning schemes for Linux - such as
making `/boot`, `/home`, etc their own partitions - you are free to do so.
Before doing so, note some unusual aspects of Bedrock's layout:

- `/usr` is not heavily used.  Rather, most of the software usually in `/usr`
  will be accessed from client Linux distributions.
- You may want to consider making `/bedrock/clients` its own partition and
  giving it a lot of space, as this is the recommended location for storing the
  client Linux distributions.
- The root directory contains the "shared" items from the clients in
  `/bedrock/clients`.  For example, in a typical Bedrock Linux setup `/tmp/`
  for the clients is stored in the root's `/tmp`  Thus, you may still wish to
  provide a decent amount of space for the root and not assume everything will
  go into `/bedrock/clients`.

Note which devices files correspond to which partitions of the Bedrock Linux
filesystem. These are normally located in `/dev`, and called `sdXN`, where `X` is a
letter a-z and `N` is a digit 0-9. This information will be used later to mount
these partitions.

Flopsie has only been tested with the ext2 and ext3 filesystems, but any
Linux-supported filesystem should work fine. If you choose to use something
other than ext2/3/4, be sure you know where to find (and how to set up)
corresponding fsck software and a bootloader which can work with that
filesystem, as these instructions will only cover ext2/3/4.

If you are dual-booting with another Linux distribution, wish to use that
distribution's bootloader, and know how to add Bedrock Linux to that
distribution's bootloader, be sure to keep the boot flag on the other
distribution's boot partition. If you would like to use Bedrock's bootloader,
be sure to set the boot flag on the proper partition (ie, either the Bedrock's
main/root partition or, if you made a special `/boot` partition, then the
`/boot` partition you made).

## {id="mounting"} Mounting Bedrock's partitions

Make a directory in which to mount Bedrock Linux's fresh to partition(s). These
instructions assumes you are using ~(/mnt/bedrock~) for this. If you would like
to use something else, be sure to change ~(/mnt/bedrock~) accordingly whenever
it comes up in these instructions. In general, when you see anything formatted
~(like this~) that is a reminder that you should consider changing the content
rather than typing/copying it verbatim.

Note that this will become Bedrock Linux's root directory when you are done. As
root:

	{class="rcmd"} mkdir -p ~(/mnt/bedrock~)

Mount the newly-created main/root partition. Replace ~(sdXN~) with the
corresponding device file to the main/root partition. As root:

	{class="rcmd"} mount /dev/~(sdXN~) ~(/mnt/bedrock~)

If you created more than one partition (other than swap) for Bedrock Linux,
make the corresponding directories and mount them.  If you are upgrading from a
prior release of Bedrock Linux, and you have partitions which contain *only* a
subset of the following, they are probably safe to mount and use.  Be sure to
back up nonetheless - using pre-existing partitions has not been well tested
and a command below may wipe them.

- `/home`
- `/root`
- `/boot`

## {id="userland"} Creating the Userland

The Bedrock Linux userland repository contains build scripts to install much of
the Bedrock Linux operating system.  Clone the latest version of the 1.0alpha4
branch from git into ~(/mnt/bedrock~).  You may use a non-root user (as
permissions will be fixed later) for this.

- {class="cmd"}
- sudo chmod a+rwx ~(/mnt/bedrock~)
- git clone --branch 1.0alpha4 https://github.com/paradigm/bedrocklinux-userland.git ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/repo
- mv ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/repo/\* ~(/mnt/bedrock~)
- rm -rf ~(/mnt/bedrock/~)repo

Download the source code for the third party components into
`~(/mnt/bedrock~)/src` alongside the `brc` and `bru` directories which should
now be there, as explained in the following sections.

### {id="src-musl"} musl

The musl libc library is required.  The project's website is available at:

[http://www.musl-libc.org/](http://www.musl-libc.org/)

At the time of writing, the latest musl release - 0.9.14 - does not have all of
the required functionality.  Either use a newer release (such as 0.9.15 or
0.10.0) if available or get the latest version from git.  The latest stable
releases and links to download them should be available here:

[http://www.musl-libc.org/download.html](http://www.musl-libc.org/download.html)

And the git repository should be available here:

    git clone git://git.musl-libc.org/musl

### {id="src-linux"} linux headers

The Linux kernel repository is required for the Linux header files.  A tarball
containing the latest Linux kernel should be found here:

[https://www.kernel.org/](https://www.kernel.org/)

### {id="src-fuse"} fuse

FUSE is required.  The project's website is available at:

[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)

At the time of writing, the latest FUSE release - 2.9.3 - does not have all of
the required functionality.  Either use a newer release (3.X) if available or
get the latest version from git.  The latest stable releases should be found
here:

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/)

And the git repository should be available here:

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/fuse/fuse fuse-fuse

At the time of writing, the latest commit has broken things.  After checking
out the repository, checkout commit dd432032db34c2ca22570af5ac6794822ef4c877

    cd fuse-fuse
    git checkout dd432032db34c2ca22570af5ac6794822ef4c877

### {id="src-busybox"} busybox

Busybox is required.  At the time of writing, the latest busybox release -
1.21.1 - does not have all of the required functionality.  Either use a newer
release (1.21.2, 1.22.0, etc) or get the latest version from git.  The latest
stable release should be available as a tarball here:

[http://www.busybox.net/](http://www.busybox.net/)

And the git repository should be available here:

    git clone git://busybox.net/busybox.git

### {id="src-cap"} Linux capabilities

The Linux Capabilities libraries and utilities are required.  The project's
website is at:

[https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/](https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/)

At the time of writing a tarball is unavailable, but the git repository is
available here:

    git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/morgan/libcap.git

At the time of writing, the latest commit has broken things.  After checking
out the repository, checkout commit 056ffb0bd25d91ffbcb83c521fc4d3d9904ec4d4

    cd libcap
    git checkout 056ffb0bd25d91ffbcb83c521fc4d3d9904ec4d4

## {id="build-userland"} Building the userland

You will need the following items to build the userland:

- A typical Linux build stack with gcc and make
- libattr1-dev (for libcap)
- autoconf (for fuse)
- libtool (for fuse)
- gettext (for fuse)

On a Debian-based system, this should install everything required:

	{class="rcmd"} apt-get install build-essential libattr1-dev libtool autoconf gettext

If you are on another system, install the equivalent packages.

To compile everything, run

- {class="cmd"}
- cd ~(/mnt/bedrock~)
- ./installer make all

If it does not complete successfully, look at the output the script generates
as well as the logs in the location indicated.  You may simply be missing a
dependency or third party source code.

To install everything, run (as root)

- {class="rcmd"}
- cd ~(/mnt/bedrock~)
- ./installer install all

You should now have everything required to use Bedrock Linux except the
following:

- clients
- a kernel, modules, etc
- a bootloader
- fsck utility
- configuration

## {id="acquire-client"} Acquiring a client

Acquire at least one client as described on [the client page](clients.html) and
return here.

## {id="kernel"} Install the Linux kernel

The client acquired in the last step will provide the kernel for Bedrock Linux.

Check if it came with a kernel:

	ls ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/boot

If so, you may skip this next step (up until "resume here").  Otherwise, chroot
into the client and acquire a client through its package manager:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp /etc/resolv.conf ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/etc
- mount -t proc proc ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/proc
- mount -t sysfs sysfs ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/sys
- mount --bind /dev ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/dev
- mount --bind /dev/pts ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/dev/pts
- chroot ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~) /bin/sh

From here, run whatever commands are necessary to install the kernel.  For
example, on x86_64 Debian-based clients, run:

	{class="rcmd"} apt-get install linux-image-amd64

or for an Arch Linux client run

	{class="rcmd"} pacman -S linux

When you have finished, run the following to clean up:

- {class="rcmd"}
- exit   #(to leave the chroot)
- umount ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/proc
- umount ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/sys
- umount ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/dev/pts
- umount ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/bedrock/clients/~(client~)/dev

If you already had a kernel installed in the client, resume here.

Next, you must copy the relevant files from the location in the client into the
core of Bedrock Linux so they can be accessed while booting.

- The kernel image itself.  This is usually located in the `/boot`
  directory and called something along the lines of ~(vmlinuz-VERSION-ARCH~).
- If the distribution from which you are getting the kernel uses a initrd (as
  most major broad-audience do), you will probably also want to copy that over
  as well.  This is often called something along the lines of
  ~(initrd.img-VERSION-ARCH~) and located with the image in `/boot`.
- Optionally, the system map file.  Like the kernel image, this is usually
  located in the `/boot` directory next to the kernel image.  It is called
  something along the lines of ~(System.map-VERSION~).  Some Linux
  distributions provide this in the same package as the kernel image while
  others do not.  If you do not know what it is, you probably do not need it.
- Optionally, the `.config` file for the kernel.  This file is useful for
  creating a new kernel based on the previous kernel's configuration.  Like the
  last few items items, this is usually located in the `/boot` directory. It is
  usually called something along the lines of ~(config-VERSION-ARCH~).  Like
  the system map, if you do not know what it is you probably do not need it.
- The modules.  You will want to copy this even if you are sharing
  `/lib/modules` with this client (as you will otherwise be sharing the core's
  *empty* `/lib/modules` with the client).  Shared items from clients only
  propogate if they are installed *while sharing is in place after booting into
  Bedrock Linux itself*.  The directory you are looking for is usually in
  `/lib/modules` and called something along the lines of the version of the
  kernel they match.  Thus, if you grabbed `vmlinuz-2.6.32-5-686` from a client
  earlier for the image, you will want to copy the `/lib/modules/2.6.32-5-686`
  directory from the client into the same place in the core Bedrock Linux.
- Optionally, the firmware.  Many Linux modules (such as wireless card drivers)
  require firmware which is usually installed into `/lib/firmware`.  Simply
  copy the contents of this directory in the client into the core's
  `/lib/firmware`.

## {id="bootloader"} Install a bootloader

Next you will need to setup Bedrock Linux to boot, either without a bootloader,
with its own bootloader or dual-booting with another operating system's
bootloader.

If you have another operating system installed which can boot a Linux
distribution and know how to add Bedrock Linux to it, feel free to do so.

If you know how to boot Linux distributions without a bootloader (leveraging
EFI, for example), you can set that up instead of installing a bootloader.

Otherwise, you should install a bootloader.  If you have a preferred bootloader
which you know how to install, go ahead and use that one.  If you do not,
limited instructions for [installing syslinux/extlinux are available
here](syslinux.html).  Follow those instructions then return here.

## {id="fsck"} Fsck

The typical `fsck` executable itself is a front-end for filesystem-specific
executables.  If you want to have Bedrock Linux run `fsck` on boot as most
other major Linux distributions do, you will need to install the
filesystem-specific executable fsck should call for your filesystem(s).  Note
that while this is recommended, it is optional - you can set "FSCK=0" in your
rc.conf to disable `fsck`, in which case you do not need to install `fsck`.

For ext2, ext3 and ext4, you can find the source for the fsck executable at
[the sourceforge page](http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/). If you would like
to use another filesystem, it should not be difficult to find the fsck for it
and install it instead, but these instructions do not cover it.

Change to the directory in which you placed the downloaded source, untar it and
enter the resulting directory:

- {class="cmd"}
- cd ~(/mnt/bedrock~)/src
- tar xvf e2fsprogs-~(VERSION~).tar.gz
- cd e2fsprogs-~(VERSION~)

Create a build directory and change directory into it:

- {class="cmd"}
- mkdir build
- cd build

Compile the fsck executables:

- {class="cmd"}
- LDFLAGS=-static ../configure
- LDFLAGS=-static make

To confirm that the desired executable was compiled statically, run

- {class="cmd"}
- ldd e2fsck/e2fsck

and check that the output is "not a dynamic executable".

To install the filesystem specific executable, simply copy it to what will be
Bedrock's `/sbin` with the names of the filesystems it supports (as root):

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp e2fsck/e2fsck ~(/mnt/bedrock/~)sbin/fsck.ext2
- cp e2fsck/e2fsck ~(/mnt/bedrock/~)sbin/fsck.ext3
- cp e2fsck/e2fsck ~(/mnt/bedrock/~)sbin/fsck.ext4

## {id="configuration"} Configuration

All of the major components should be installed at this point; all that remains
is to edit the configuration files as desired.  The instructions to do so are
broken up into two parts:

- The instructions which are applicable to most Linux distributions - such as
  how to add users and set the system's hostname - are are below.
- The instructions which are wholly unique to Bedrock Linux - such as
  configuration for clients - are on another page (so that they can be
  referenced more conveniently outside of the context of installation).

### {id="add-users"} Add users

The `install` script defaults to having two users, "root" and "brroot".
"root" is the normal root user.  "brroot" is actually the same user (both have
UID 0); it is simple an alternative login which will always log in to Bedrock
Linux's core rather than a shell from a client.  While "brroot" is not
required, it is quite useful as a fall-back in case the you would like to use a
shell from a client for root and that client breaks.

The next handful of command should be run in a chroot:

	{class="rcmd"} chroot ~(/mnt/bedrock~) /bin/sh

The root user (and brroot) both have default passwords of "bedrock".  To change
this to something else, run

	{class="rcmd"} passwd -a sha512

Note that this will only change root's password; the brroot login for the same
user will still have the default password.  To change brroot password to the
same thing, run:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cat /etc/shadow | awk '!/^brroot:/{print$0}/^root:/{print "br"$0}' > /tmp/tmpshadow; mv /tmp/tmpshadow /etc/shadow

Next, add normal user(s) as desired:

- {class="rcmd"}
- adduser -s /bedrock/bin/brsh -D ~(USERNAME~)
- passwd -a sha512 ~(USERNAME~)

If you would like to create a "br-" version of these users which will use the
same password to log in but will always log in to the core of Bedrock Linux,
run the following for each user *once*:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/^~(USERNAME~):/br&/' | sed 's,:[^:]\*$,:/bin/sh,' >> /etc/passwd
- cat /etc/shadow | sed 's/^~(USERNAME~):/br&/' >> /etc/shadow

Once you have completed adding all of the desired users and setting their
passwords, you may exit the chroot

	{class="rcmd"} exit

### {id="hostname"} Hostname

The default hostname is "bedrock-box".  To change this, edit
`~(/mnt/bedrock~)/etc/hostname` as desired.

Change "bedrock-box" in `~(/mnt/bedrock~)/etc/hosts` to your desired hostname
as well.

### {id="bedrock-specific-config"} Bedrock-Specific Configuration

See [the flopsie configuration page](configure.html) for instructions on how to
configure Bedrock Linux specific functionality such as clients.

### {id="post-reboot"} Post-Reboot

Reboot into Bedrock Linux and run the last command to set it up.  Log in
as root and run:

	{class="rcmd"} brp

Everything should be good to go.  If you run into any difficulties, try
reviewing the relevant documentation pages for this release, and if that
doesn't help sufficiently, don't hesitate to drop into the IRC channel.

Enjoy!
